A Blurring of Boundaries Between Two City Areas 
===
By KIRK  JOHNSON

Defining the exact border  between Manhattan neighborhoods such as Yorkville and the Upper  East Side can be a tricky  business, complicated by  history, local pride, real estatevalues, and wishful thinking. 

Generally, Yorkville is considered to extend from 79th to 96th Street and from  either Lexington or Third avenue to the East River. But since land values are generally higher if they can be associated with the chic Upper East Side name, developers  building  in fringe areas tend to disregard the old boundaries and take the name that promises the highest value. 

As a result, the current wave of construction north of 90th Street, Yorkville appears to be shrinking while the Upper East  side is growing. One of these projects, on Second Avenue between 93rd and 94th Streets, is about to begin marketing, and the developer is trying to have it both ways. 

The project, called Astor Terrace, is situated according to its promotional literature, "in the heart of Manhattan's vigorous new Upper East Side." At the same time, a major selling pitch for Astor Terrace is relative affordability and more space for the money that can be found in the more traditionally define Upper East Side Area.
